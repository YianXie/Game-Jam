# Game Jam (Journey to the East)
## Theme: Duality ##

## Play style ##
This is a 2D adventure game expecting players to upgrade their gears by defeating monsters and bosses. In order to provide a better gaming experience, there are multiple skills and abilities that the player can unlock that help them, such as sprint and Chi attacks. 

## Code ##
This game is mainly made with JavaScript with [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/). There are some HTML and CSS codes as well, though they are not the main part of the game. 

## Contributers ##
Thanks very much for Barry Hang and Rick Yang helping me with the game! Without them, I would not be able to create it.
